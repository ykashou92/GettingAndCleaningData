# Code Book

This is a summary of data fields in `tidyData.txt`, the output of the `run_analysis.R` script also available in this repository.

# About the raw data
## The test dataset
The features are unlabeled and can be found in the X_test.txt. 
The activity labels are in the Y_test.txt file. 
The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.
## The train dataset
The features are unlabeled and can be found in the X_train.txt. 
The activity labels are in the Y_train.txt file. 
The test subjects are in the subject_train.txt file.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Measurements
Most of the measurements are X, Y or Z coordinate-based however some of the sensor data calculates frequency, magnitude as well as mean and standard deviation

## Activity Labels
Activities are identified with 6 different labels, depending on the state of the subject during the test

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test
